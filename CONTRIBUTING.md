# Contributing

We're glad you're here!  
This open-source project is available for new and experienced developers to practice working together
on a large, collaborative web app.

## Overview

This project uses:

- Node.js platform
- Express web framework
- Model-View-Controller design pattern
- An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to make it easy to switch out data stores
- Express routing

## Code Quality

We use a variety of tools to keep our code standard and high-quality.

Please see the README.md for instructions on how to use these tools to your advantage.

## Issues

Participants are welcome to open issues as well as contribute code.
Add your voice to technology choices, code design, tool recommendations and more.

## Pull Requests

Generally, there are few reasons that a pull request might not be accepted:

- If they have multiple conflicting files. Just pull fresh code and try again.
- If they violate community guidelines.
- If the updated code causes the project to fail to build and/or run.

We suggest adding try/catch blocks and improved error handling, asking for help, fixing the issue, and/or trying again.

## Requests

We suggest:

- Start small - add files, add your author name in the comment block.
- Never work on stale code - keep your project current.
- Don't break the build!

Your code doesn't have to be in final form - however, ensure the app builds and runs locally
before creating your pull request.

## Versioning

Unlike industry projects, in our package.json, we tend to use the "lastest" version of our dependencies.

We'd rather stay current and address issues now.
It's all about learning, adapting, and having fun coding.
We appreciate your contributions.
