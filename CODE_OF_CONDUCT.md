Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Inappropriate language, imagery, attention or comments
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

## Consequences of Unacceptable behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including mentors and
those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in unacceptable behavior,
mentors may take any action they deem appropriate,
up to and including limiting participation in the community.

## Scope

in all community venues (online and in-person) and in one-on-one communications.
